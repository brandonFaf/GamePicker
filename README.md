# GamePicker
iOS application to pick the winners of games in the 2015 NFL Season

This app was writen mainly in ES6 Javascript using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) version 0.8.0-rc.2. This application is only for iOS devices.

The application uses a Parse database to save the NFL schedule, the winners of the games, and user's picks. 
The React Native code interacts with the Parse database via native modules writen in Obj-C

Unfortunately, Parse has been retired so this code will not work after Jan 31, 2017.
Have no fear! There is a brand new version of GamePicker for 2016. (link coming soon)
